>It was on the fifteenth of June, 1767, that Cosimo Piovasco di Rondò, my brother, sat among us for the last time. And it might have been today, I remember it so clearly. We were in the dining room of our house at Ombrosa, the windows framing the thick branches of the great holm oak in the park. It was midday, the old traditional dinner hour followed by our family, though by then most nobles had taken to the fashion set by the sluggard Court of France, of dining halfway through the afternoon. A breeze was blowing from the sea, I remember, rustling the leaves. Cosimo said: "I told you I don't want any, and I don't!" and pushed away his plateful of snails. Never had we seen such disobedience.

>我的哥哥柯西莫柯西莫·皮奥瓦斯科·迪·隆多最后一次坐在我们中间的那一天是一七六七年六月十五日。我记得很清楚，事情好像就发生在今天一样。大家坐在翁布罗萨我家别墅的餐室里，几扇窗户都嵌满了花园里那颗高大的圣栎树的繁茂枝条。时间正当中午，我们全家人按老规矩在这个时候坐到餐桌边，虽然那时从不习惯早起的法国宫廷传来的下午吃正餐的时尚已在贵族之中风行。我记得有风从海上吹来，树叶抖动。柯西莫说着：“我说过不要，我就是不要！”推开那盘蜗牛。他往常可从来没有闹过那么凶。
