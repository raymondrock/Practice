>It was on the fifteenth of June, 1767, that Cosimo Piovasco di Rondò, my brother, sat among us for the last time. And it might have been today, I remember it so clearly. We were in the dining room of our house at Ombrosa, the windows framing the thick branches of the great holm oak in the park. It was midday, the old traditional dinner hour followed by our family, though by then most nobles had taken to the fashion set by the sluggard Court of France, of dining halfway through the afternoon. A breeze was blowing from the sea, I remember, rustling the leaves. Cosimo said: "I told you I don't want any, and I don't!" and pushed away his plateful of snails. Never had we seen such disobedience.

时至今日，我仍然清楚地记得，我的哥哥柯西莫·皮奥瓦斯科·迪·隆多最后一次和我们坐在一起是在一七六七年的六月十五日。午时，我们坐在翁布罗萨的宅邸餐厅，从这里的窗户望过去，能看见巨大粗壮的圣栎树的树干。我们遵循着古老的家族传统用餐，或者说，这样的传统也是骄奢淫逸的法国宫廷里流传出来的风尚，午餐会一直持续到下午。我记得，一阵海上来的微风拂过，树叶颤动。“我已经说过了，我不想吃！我不要！”，柯西莫推走那盘蜗牛。我们从来没有看过这样的忤逆行为。
