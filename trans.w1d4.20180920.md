## practice
“He hasn’t much faith.” 
*他没有足够的信念。*

“No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?” 
*“没错，”，老人说道，“我们有的，不是吗？”*

“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff home.” 
*“嗯！”，男孩说道，“我们在阳台喝点啤酒，然后把东西带回家，怎样？”*

“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.” 
*“可以，可以。”，老人说道，“两个渔夫之间的小酌。”*

They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. 
*他们坐在阳台上。很多渔夫取笑老人，可他也不生气。*

Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. 
*那些上了年纪的，看着他，心里有些难过。*

But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. 
*不过他们并没有把难过挂在脸上，他们有礼节地谈论着近况、鱼线深度、持续的好天气和他们所见到的一切。*

The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana.
*当天获得好收成的渔夫们也来了。他们宰了马林鱼，把鱼放平在两块木板间，其中两个人拖着木板的一端，吃力蹒跚地向鱼库走去。鱼会在那里被装上冷藏卡车，运到哈瓦那的集市。*

Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting. 
*那些捉到了鲨鱼的，去了山坳另一边的鲨鱼加工厂。在那里，鲨鱼会被吊在滑轮组上，它们的肝脏被摘除，鳍被切下，皮被剥掉，肉也被切成条拿去用盐腌藏起来。*


When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbor from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odor because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
*刮东风的时候，会送来鲨鱼加工厂的味道。不过今天风往北去了，风力很弱，阳台上风和日丽，鲨鱼加工厂的气味也很难闻得到。*

“Santiago,” the boy said. “Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago. 
*“圣地亚哥，”，男孩说。“没错！”，老人回应着，拿着酒杯回想起多年前的往事。*

“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?” 
*明天我可以和你一起去捕沙丁鱼么？*

“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
*算了吧，还是去玩垒球吧。我还是划得动船的，罗杰里奥会帮我撒网。*

“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way.” 
*我很想去。如果不能和你一起捕鱼，那我也可以帮着干点别的。*

“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.” 
*“你给我买了啤酒，你已经是大人啦。”，老人说道。*

“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
*你第一次带我出海的时候，我多大啊？*

“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?” 
*“那时你五岁。当我把大鱼往船上弄得时候，船都像要被整坏了，你也差点死掉啦，还记得么？”

“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.” 
*“我能想起来，当时那条鱼的尾巴扑通扑通地拍打着船，弄坏了划手座，还有那阵阵棒击的声音。我还记得，那时你把我扔到了船首，那里的钓索湿漉漉的。我能感觉到整条船都在颤抖，你棒打那条鱼的声音，就像在砍一棵树。空气里弥漫着甜腥的血的味道。”*

“Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?” 
*”你自己记得，还是我告诉了你这些？“*

“I remember everything from when we first went together.” The old man looked at him with his sunburned, confident loving eyes.
*“和你第一次出海后的一切，我都记得真真切切。“。老人用他双晒伤、自信的眼神，怜爱地看着男孩。*
