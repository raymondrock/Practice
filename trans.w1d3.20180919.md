## practice

He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. 
*一个老人独驾轻舟，在墨西哥湾捕鱼。八十天多去了，仍一无所获。*

In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. 
*四十天前，有个男孩一直跟随着他。四十天过去了，他们一条鱼都没有捕到。男孩的父母告诉他，这个老人现在肯定是倒了大霉运，是最不走运的那种。男孩听从了父母之命，到了另一艘船上，第一周里就捕来了三条上好的鱼。*

It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. 
*每天老人驾着空船来时，男孩的心里都不是滋味。他一直帮着老人带上钓索、鱼钩、鱼叉，还有在桅杆上卷好的帆。*

The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat. 
*帆用面粉袋打了补丁，卷好的时候，看上去就像是一面失败的旗帜。*

The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. 
*老人瘦削如柴，后脖子布满深深的褶皱。*

The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. 
*热带海洋反射的阳光，在他的两颊上留下了棕色的良性癌瘢*

The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. 
*这些瘢和他的脸显得很相称。他的双手因为常年提起重重的鱼，与绳索摩擦，深深刻上了皱巴巴的伤痕。*

But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert. 
*这些疤痕都很老了。老得像在没有鱼的沙漠里的侵蚀物。*

Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated. 
*唯一不显老的，就是他的那双像海一样蓝的眼睛，快乐明亮，不可击败。*

“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.” 
*“圣地亚哥，”男孩对他说，他们在海岸停船处攀。“我们还可以一起，也曾赚过不少钱。”*

The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
*老人曾经教会了男孩捕鱼，男孩也爱这个老人。*

“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.” 
*“不了”，老人说道，“你呆的那条船有好运。还是跟他们在一起吧。”*

“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks.” 
*你已经整整八十七天没有打上来鱼了。你记得吗？我们一起在三个星期里，每天都会捕上点大的。*

“I remember,” the old man said, “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
*“我记得”，老人说道，“我知道你没有离开我，是因为你还有疑虑。”* 

“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
*“是我父亲逼我的。我是个孩子，我必须服从他。”*

“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
*“我知道，”老人说道，“人之常情。”*
